Header row (column names) — short explanation for each:

- UDI — unique identifier for the row / observation (record index).  
- Product ID — product or unit identifier (string code for the specific part/machine).  
- Type — categorical product/machine type (e.g., L, M, H).  
- Air temperature [K] — ambient air temperature in Kelvin.  
- Process temperature [K] — process (internal) temperature in Kelvin.  
- Rotational speed [rpm] — shaft/machine rotational speed in revolutions per minute.  
- Torque [Nm] — torque in Newton-meters.  
- Tool wear [min] — tool wear / usage in minutes (how long the tool has been used).  
- Machine failure — overall binary failure flag (1 = failure occurred for that observation, 0 = no failure).  
- TWF — Tool Wear Failure (binary flag for that failure mode).  
- HDF — Heat Dissipation / Heating-related Failure (binary flag for that failure mode).  
- PWF — Power Failure (binary flag for that failure mode).  
- OSF — Overstrain Failure (binary flag for that failure mode).  
- RNF — Random/Noise Failure (binary flag for that failure mode).

“Since physical DC motor fault datasets are limited, we adapted the AI4I predictive maintenance dataset by mapping its mechanical and thermal features to DC motor electrical parameters.
